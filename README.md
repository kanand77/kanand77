### Hi there üëãüèΩ

I'm currently a second year CS student at Stanford pursuing the AI track. 

I have experience working with research teams on large machine learning projects, being heavily involved as a core engineer at a biotech startup, and contributing to Open Source projects with hackathon pods. 

Languages I'm familiar with: 
<img alt="Python" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/python%20-%2314354C.svg?&style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white"/>
 - Python, Jupyter Notebooks
   - Frameworks: Keras, Tensorflow, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
 - C/C++
 - MATLAB
 - HTML5, CSS3
 
 I'm looking for employment opportunities to gain access to expert mentorship and further expand my technological skillsets.
