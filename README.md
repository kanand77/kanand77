### Hi there 👋🏽

I'm currently a second year CS student at Stanford pursuing the AI track. 

I have experience working with research teams on large machine learning projects, being heavily involved as a core engineer at a biotech startup, and contributing to Open Source projects with hackathon pods. 

Languages I'm familiar with: 
 - Python, Jupyter Notebooks
   - Frameworks: Keras, Tensorflow, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib
 - C/C++
 - MATLAB
 - HTML5, CSS3
 
 I'm looking for employment opportunities to gain access to expert mentorship and further expand my technological skillsets.
